# [DSA4264] Sense-making Case Analysis: Public Policy and Society

This GitHub repository is for NUS students taking DSA4264.  

## Setting up the repository

You should set up your own virtual environment on your laptop to run all the notebooks in this repository. You may do this in your preferred way, but a simple way to set this up would be:

1. Run `python -m venv venv` to create your virtual environment (note that I am using Python 3.11.5)
2. Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the full list of requirements

## Code notebooks

For selected weeks, there will be a Jupyter notebook with some code for you to follow along and to do some exercises in the class. I will push the notebook to this repository one day beforehand, but the full notebook (with the answers to all the exercises) will only be made available on 2 days after the class.
